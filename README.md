# rugby_union_stats
This is a repository I will be using in order to web-scrape and analyse rugby union data. 

You must have Python 3.0 and greater to run this code. 
You malso must have a chromedriver installed -- (can be adjusted to use other drivers).

Further updates to this code is coming soon
